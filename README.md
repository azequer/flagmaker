# flagmaker
flagmaker is basically a node program that auto generates fflags
# how to use
this was meant for android roblox but if u still wanna try it somewhere else then

u can change the path in makeflags.sh and the curl url to whatever u want

then ur gonna want to make a ``override.json`` file with the fflags that u want
heres a example of what it should look like
```
{
"FFlagDebugDisplayFPS": true
}
```

once ur done, u can just ``./makeflags.sh``
